Why to learn React..?

    - Is it for getting a job..?
    - As React is the market trend & got so much hype, Hence are we learning react..?
        - → cuzz tomorrow some new tchnology will be market trend & will get hyped
    - Is it to build UI..?
        - → cuz we can build using HTML, CSS & JS (or) even AngularJS and so on..
    - No..!
    - It makes easy to manage & build Complex FrontEnd



Why React was created..?

    - FB has a problem called Phanthom/Ghost Messaging Problem
    - Phanthom/Ghost Messaging  → Notifications shows unread messages even when we don’t have any.
    - Here, state is managed by JS & UI is managed by DOM. And both of these are NOT in sync hence caused this Ghost messages
    - To solve this problem → React is created



What is React..?

    - React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on components
        - React is NOT a Framework but a Library.



React Drawbacks

    - React is NOT a complete solution in most cases
        - React doesn’t have Router
        - React doesn’t have State Management
        - React has NO SEO by default
        - React code is rendered back to JS, HTML & CSS → which is called compiling & is a heavy work



Difference between a Library & Framework..?

    - Both libraries and frameworks are collections of pre-written code that developers can utilize to speed up the application development process
    - The key technical difference between a framework and library lies in a term called "inversion of control".
        - When you use a library, you are in charge of the flow of the application
            - You are choosing when and where to call the library. [we plug in the library code in our own code]
        - When you use a framework, the framework is in charge of the flow
            - It provides some places for you to plug in your code, but it calls the code you plugged in as needed
