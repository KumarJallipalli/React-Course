What is Tailwind..?

    - It is a utility-first CSS framework which
        - i.e., we can use utility classes to build custom designs without writing CSS as in the traditional approach.
    - Tailwind automatically removes all unused CSS when building for production
    - Tailwind lets you build responsive designs right in your HTML instead.

What are props..?

    - Props are the information that you pass to a JSX tag
    - React components use `*props*` to communicate with each other.
        - Every parent component can pass some information to its child components by giving them props.
    - Props are arguments passed into React components.
        - Props are passed to components via HTML attributes.
        - The component receives the argument as a `props` object
    - Props might remind you of HTML attributes, but you can pass any JavaScript value through them, including objects, arrays, and functions.
